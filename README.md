# Participles_Emotion
This repository contains data for a study on participles of verbs of emotion in Russian

All the examples are annotated for three parameters:
- animacy of the stimulus (in case a conjoined NP with an animate and inanimate part is used, the example is annotated as "both")
- construction type (long form of the participle, short form of the participle with a copula, etc.)
- verb lemma
- morphological case of the participle (long forms only)
